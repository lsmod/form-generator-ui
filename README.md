# Form creator

Experimental project. Just Playing arround with yew.rs and spectre css (https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

UI visible at this page:\
https://lsmod.github.io/form-generator-ui/

## Idea

The idea is to generate code for creating forms. The Main goal is to speed up development process by generating a lot of boilerplate code.

The UI make easy to create a model from which the form code gets generated.

## Follow up

I'm done with this experiment for the time being.\
To be a pratical tool it should make easy to customize form template.
Askama is really nice but doesn't offer that flexibility.
